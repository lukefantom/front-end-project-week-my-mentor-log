# My Mentor Log

Week 8 - 1 Week Group Project

Personal development application, built during a 1-week project in a team of 4 where users are able to keep track of mentor meetings using a custom-built notes application. 

A full-stack app aimed to provide more structure to meetings between Bootcampers and their Mentors. I primarily focused on the back-end, creating a restful API built in Node.js, providing access to our database hosted through Heroku using PostgreSQL. We constructed a clean and modern front- end using React and create-react-app, implementing modules such as Firebase and Luxon.

## The brief

The brief we were given was to build an application which enhances the School of Code mentoring experience. Our user research found there is a lack of structure with regards to meteing with mentors, across multiple plaforms. A common problem was the inconsistency in organising meetings and a need for some more structure around the entire process, where all three parties (mentors, coaches and students) have more visibility.

## Our Solution

- Bootcamper journal to help the student to reflect on and articulate their SoC experience, so that they are able to have more meaningful discussions with their mentors.
- Give clear discussion points to help them evaluate how they are doing, so that they can get help and advice during their regular sessions.
- A place to keep track of meeting notes, goals, ideas and aspirations.
- Provides structure to the meetings with a clear agenda.
- Future ambition - Also to give the coaches visibility of if the meetings are taking place on a regular basis and how they are going.
